# Phase invert DSP plugin

Inverts phase of first channel. 

Compile using WinAmp SDK: http://download.nullsoft.com/winamp/plugin-dev/WA5.55_SDK.exe  
Or download binary (DLL) from releases.

## Why?
Useful for messed up movies (often camrips) which sound has inverted phase of one channel, therefore sounds "silly".  
Can be used in video players like PotPlayer, GOM Player, ...
